Frequency rules are a set of rules used to define the number of times a Contact should be contacted by any means in Mautic. Email and SMS have been implemented at this stage, but should also apply other Forms of Contact as necessary. Such as social media mentions or messages sent in the future.

How to set frequency rules

* Globally, from the configuration panel can set frequency rules globally from the configuration panel on both the Email and SMS settings.


* Frequency rules can also be applied on a Contact's detail page from the dropdown menu on the upper right-hand side. In this area, you can select the Channels where you want the rules to apply, and setting the rule here overrides the general settings.
