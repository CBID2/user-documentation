Frequency rules are a set of rules used to define the number of times a Contact should be contacted by any means in Mautic. Email and SMS have been implemented at this stage, but this should also apply to other Channels as appropriate, such as social media mentions or messages sent in another Channel.

How to set frequency rules
***************************

* Globally, from the configuration panel, you can set frequency rules for both Email and SMS settings.


* Individually, from a Contact's detail page under the dropdown menu on the upper right-hand side, you can select the Channels where you want the rules to apply.  Setting the rule here overrides the general settings.
