"A Campaign is a marketing activity that aligns Components and the Channels "
"through which you can publish your content in a coordinated, strategically "
"timed approach to meet specific business objectives. After you add your "
"Contacts and set up the required Channels, you can create Campaigns to build"
" meaningful relationships with your Contacts."

"Campaigns are useful for Contact management, marketing operations, and sales"
" workflows. A Campaign can send tailored messages to all Contacts in the "
"Segment, or a subset of Contacts that you specify. You can set the Campaign "
"schedule to send the message once or at a recurring interval, such as once a"
" week."

"One of the main benefits of the Campaign workflow process is the ability to "
"predefine these workflows and have them respond automatically to your "
"Contacts and timelines. This automation minimizes the amount of time "
"required for manual Contact activity and improves reliability of Contact "
"nurturing."

"Time driven Campaigns are the type of Campaigns that center around specific "
"timed events. These events can be anything, but are usually Emails. For "

"Contact driven Campaigns can trigger events based on interactions with "
"specific Contacts. These interactions can occur as a result of the Contact "
"landing on a certain webpage or Landing Page, opening an Email, spending a "
"specified amount of time on a website, or any other activities. Such "
"Campaigns can respond to these actions typically by sending an Email to the "
"Contact either immediately or at a specific time in future."

"Mautic allows you to create Campaigns which consist a mix of both time "
"driven Campaigns as well as Contact driven actions. This powerful mixed "
"Campaign strategy drives actions by both specific dates or after specific "
"time frames, as well as actions taken by a Contact directly."

"Campaigns can trigger a variety of actions. Email actions mentioned in the "
"preceding Campaign types are one example. The other actions that a Campaign "
"can trigger include automatic assignment to a new Segment, assigning a new "
"Point value, or pushing into an Integration, into a CRM or other systems."
