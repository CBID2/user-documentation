Manage Themes
#############

.. vale on

Themes control the look and feel of the Mautic landing pages, Emails, Forms and message screens. A basic Mautic installation comes pre-packaged with a number of Themes which can be used 'as-is' or adapted to suit specific projects. It's also possible to :xref:`create a Theme` for Mautic from scratch.

Since Mautic 2.1.0, you can access the Theme Manager via the Admin Menu. Click the cog icon in the top right corner to open it and select the Theme menu item.

The Themes page displays the list of Themes with the following details:

**Title** - The name or title of the Theme.

**Author** - The name of the author or creator of the Theme.

**Feature** - The list of features that the Theme supports.

This list of Themes appears as selectable options in Forms. Additionally, you can edit and customize them in the Email and Landing Page builders to meet your companyâ€™s needs. With the Email and Landing Page builders, you can build Email and Landing Page Themes as templates. For more information, see :doc:`Email builder</builders/email_landing_page>` and :doc:`Landing Pages</components/landing_pages>`. Also, the templates saved from the landing page and Email builders appear in the list of Themes on the Themes page.
