"Make sure that you aren't testing the Page visit while logged into Mautic. "
"Mautic ignores activity from Mautic Administrators. So, it's suggested that "
"you use an anonymous session, an incognito window, another browser, or log "
"out of Mautic."

"Ensure that the Contact getting tracked is in the Campaign. The easy way to "
"test this is to review the timeline of the Contact for the page hit / "
"inclusion into the Campaign."

"Mautic executes Campaigns sequentially and won't repeat per Contact. If the "
"Contact has already visited the Page while part of the Campaign and "
"triggered the Visits a Page decision, then the Contact's subsequent visits "
"won't re-trigger the actions associated with the decision."

"Ensure that the URL in the Campaign action either matches exactly the URL "
"visited, or use a wildcard. A URL can include the schema, host/domain, path,"
" query parameters, and/or fragment. For example, if you have a URL of "
"``https://example.com`` and the page hit registers as "
"``https://example.com/index.php?foo=bar``, the Campaign decision won't "
"trigger. However, if you use ``https://example.com*`` as the URL, it matches"
" the rule and thus gets triggered."

"Another example is if you want to associate different page hits with "
"specific Campaigns. For example, if you have Campaign A and Campaign B and "
"you want to use the same base URL and path for both Campaigns but "
"differentiate with a query parameter. For Campaign A, you can define a "
"Visits a Page decision with ``https://example.com/my-page?utm_campaign=A*`` "
"and for Campaign B, ``https://example.com/my-page?utm_campaign=B*``. A "
"Contact only triggers the specific Campaign desired. If the goal is to "
"trigger both Campaigns regardless of the query parameters, use "
"``https://example.com/my-page*``."
